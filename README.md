# Term project for ITCS 3112 - Evolution Simulator
## Code written by Tyler Wardle and Candace Allison

Note to Myself:
***
To compile class only C++ file: 
`g++ -c <file>.cpp`
***
To link 2 classes together
* For testing purposes
* Assume one class uses the other as a variable
* Assume the class using the other contains a main method
* To do this, be sure to compile each class separately 

`g++ -o Class1 class1.o class2.o`
